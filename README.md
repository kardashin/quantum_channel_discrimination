# Quantum environment classification
This repository contains the code used for our paper [Quantum-machine-learning channel discrimination
](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.106.032409)

In *Discrimination* folder, there are programs for the variational channel discrimination algorithms for two strategies: parallel and sequential.

In *Classification* folder, there are programs for the classification of quantum channels using variational circuits and kernel methods. 

Some notebooks may be slightly outdated and contain a lot of garbage.
