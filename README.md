# Quantum environment classification
A project on building a quantum classifier which is capable of differentiating between two (possibly many) quantum channels.

The problem being solved is the following.
A quantum state is generated and sent through one of two qunatum channels.
The task is to build a quantum classifier telling through wihich of the channels the quantum state has passed.

The problem was solved with the two approaches:
- variational quantum circuits;
- quantum kernel estimation.
